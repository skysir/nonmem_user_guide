 MEANING: Organized elements of a NONMEM Data Set
 CONTEXT: NONMEM output

 DISCUSSION:
 A  NONMEM  data  set  consists  of a series of data records; each data
 record, in turn, consists of a series of  data  items,  the  names  of
 which  are  defined  on  the  $INPUT  record.   NONMEM counts the data
 records and displays this count in its output as a check for the user.
 This  count is of logical records as read by a FORTRAN format specifi-
 cation, which is also displayed in the output.  If the format specifi-
 cation  contains  no slash (/) characters (which denote the start of a
 new FORTRAN record), then each logical record corresponds to a FORTRAN
 record.

       NO. OF DATA RECS IN DATA SET:  394

 (See data item, data set).
