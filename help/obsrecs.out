 MEANING: Those data records containing observation information
 CONTEXT: NONMEM input/output

 DISCUSSION:
 A  data  record  may contain an observation, in which case the missing
 dependent variable (MDV) data item (which  may  be  specified  by  the
 user,  or  created  for  him by NM-TRAN when PREDPP is used) should be
 zero, and the dependent variable (DV) data item should be the observa-
 tion.   If a data record does not contain an observation, the MDV data
 item should be 1 or 101, and the DV data item may be any value.   NON- |
 MEM  counts  observation  records.  It also must know in what position
 (column) of a data record the DV data item appears.   It  reports  its
 information  about  these  things  as  a check to the user, as in this
 example:

  DEP VARIABLE IS DATA ITEM NO.:   4
      .
      .
  TOT. NO. OF OBS RECS:     394

 (See dv, mdv).
