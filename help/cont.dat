 MEANING: Continuation (CONT) data item for PREDPP
 CONTEXT: $INPUT record and NONMEM data set

 USAGE:
 $INPUT ... CONT ...

 DISCUSSION:
 CONT  labels PREDPP's continuation (CONT) data item.  The continuation
 data item is optional.  The CONT  data  item  allows  a  PREDPP  event
 record to span several data records.  It is useful when more than NON- |
 MEM's maximum number of data items per record are needed to describe a |
 single  event.   When  the CONT data item is not defined on the $INPUT
 record, every event record consists of a single data record.

 Values are:

 0    This is the last or only data record of the event record.

 1    This and the succeeding record are both members of the same event
      record.  MDV must be 1.

 PREDPP  ignores  records  having CONT=1, except to pass them to the PK
 and ERROR routines as part of the complete event  record.   Values  of
 PREDPP data items such as EVID, AMT, etc., are significant only on the
 final record of each event record, i.e., on records having CONT=0.

 With NM-TRAN abbreviated code, values on data  records  having  CONT=1
 are  not available for use as right-hand quantities, i.e., abbreviated
 code cannot reference the values in data records other than  the  last
 of  each event record.  (It would be possible to reference such values
 using verbatim code, however).  When NM-TRAN performs time translation
 or ii conversion, it does so only for the event records having CONT=0.
 (See date, time, ii).
