 MEANING: The elements of a NONMEM Data Record
 CONTEXT: NONMEM output

 DISCUSSION:
 Each  data  record  consists of a series of data items, the labels for
 which are defined on the $INPUT  record.   Data  items  are  of  three
 types:  NONMEM  items,  PREDPP items, and others.  The first two types
 are signified by certain reserved labels, such as (for NONMEM  items):
 ID  (for  IDentification), MDV (for Missing Dependent Variable), or DV
 (for Dependent Variable).  NONMEM prints the labels of the data  items
 in  the  order  it understands them to appear on the data records as a
 check for the user.

 LABELS TO BE USED FOR ITEMS APPEARING IN TABLES AND SCATTERPLOTS ARE:
    ID    TIME    DV    AGE      WT    PRED    RES     WRES

 The above states that the first data item is  ID  (NONMEM  item),  the
 second  is TIME (a PREDPP item), the third is DV (a NONMEM item), then
 AGE and WT, which are other items, and finally  PRED,  RES  and  WRES,
 which  are  NONMEM-generated  items  -- the predicted value of DV, the
 residual (DV-PRED), and the weighted residual (a transformation of RES
 to units of the population standard deviation).
