 MEANING: Specification of empirical steady-state dose for PREDPP
 CONTEXT: $INPUT record and NONMEM data set

 DISCUSSION:

 With  some systems, steady state cannot be computed by the usual meth-
 ods requested by the SS data item.  The Empirical steady state  method
 computes  steady  state  by  giving  a large number of doses until the
 state variables no longer change according to the SSTOL/SSATOL  toler-
 ance specified in $SUBROUTINES.  The SS data item is not used.  A neg-
 ative value of ADDL requests the computation, and also  specifies  the
 maximum  number of doses (ABS(ADDL)+1).  Interdose interval II is used
 as usual.

 Reserved variables ADDL_ACTUAL and  ADDL_TIME  and  ADDL_TIMEDIFF  are
 given useful values.

 State")
