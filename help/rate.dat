 MEANING: Dose Rate (RATE) data item for PREDPP
 CONTEXT: $INPUT record and NONMEM data set

 USAGE:
 $INPUT ... RATE ...

 DISCUSSION:
 RATE  labels  PREDPP's dose rate (RATE) data item.  The dose rate data
 item is optional.  In a dose or reset-dose event record  it  can  take
 four kinds of values.

 0    The dose is an instantaneous bolus dose.

 >0   The  dose  is  an infusion, and the value of RATE gives its rate.
      If this is not a steady-state infusion, the AMT data item must be
      positive also.  If this is a steady-state dose event record, both
      AMT and RATE may be 0; (See ss dose).

 -1   The dose is a zero-order bolus dose,  i.e.,  an  infusion,  whose
      rate  is  modeled  in the PK routine.  As an example, suppose the
      compartment being dosed is numbered 1 (e.g., the  CMT  data  item
      contains  1,  or  it  contains 0 and compartment 1 is the default
      compartment for doses).  The $PK abbreviated code must  define  a
      value  for  R1,  the  rate  parameter  for  compartment  1, e.g.,
      R1=THETA(4)+ETA(4)

 -2   The dose is a zero-order bolus dose,  i.e.,  an  infusion,  whose
      duration  is  modeled  in the PK routine.  As an example, suppose
      the compartment being dosed is numbered  1  as  above.   The  $PK
      abbreviated code must define a value for D1, the duration parame-
      ter for compartment 1, e.g., D1=THETA(4)+ETA(4)

 RATE must be 0 for observation, other-type, and reset event records.
