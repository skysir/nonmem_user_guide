 MEANING: NONMEM's estimate of inter-subject variance shrinkage
 CONTEXT: NONMEM output

 DISCUSSION:

 Shrinkage data are included in the results between #TERM and #TERE.

      With NONMEM 7.3, these are
      ETAshrink
      EBVshrink
      EPSshrink

      For details, see the NONMEM 7 guide.

      With NONMEM 7.4, these are
      ETAshrinkSD (called ETAshrink in NM73)
      ETAshrinkVR
      EBVshrinkSD (called EBVshrink in NM73)
      EBVshrinkVR
      EPSshrinkSD (called EPSshrink in NM73)
      EPSshrinkVR

      For details, see the NONMEM 7.4 guide

 With  NM73 and later, option ETASTYPE=1 in the $EST record, will aver-
 age shrinkage information only among individuals that provided a  non-
 zero derivative of their data likelihood with respect to that eta, and
 will not include subjects with a non-influential eta, that is in which
 the derivative of the data likelihood is zero.

 Furthermore,  you  may  specify  eta  i  of  particular subjects to be
 excluded or  included  using  reserved  variable  ETASXI(i).   (ETASXI
 stands for eta shrinkage exclude/include).
 (See etasxi).

 Shrinkage  data  are  also  given  in file root.shk File root.shm is a
 shrinkage map describing which etas were  included or excluded in  the
 eta shrinkage assessment.
