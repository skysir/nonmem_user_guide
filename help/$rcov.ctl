 MEANING:  Inputting Variance-Covariance information from another prob-
 lem
 CONTEXT: NM-TRAN Control Record

 USAGE:
 $RCOV
        FILE=filename [FORMAT|DELIM=s1]  [TBLN=n]
 $RCOVI
        FILE=filename [FORMAT|DELIM=s1]  [TBLN=n]

 SAMPLE:
 $RCOV FILE=sirsample.cov TBLN=1 DELIM=,

 The $RCOV record can be used to load the variance-covariance matrix of
 estimates  results  from a previous problem, and use it for subsequent
 use in assessing total standard errors of table items  without  having
 to re-calculate the variance with a $COV step.

 The  record  $RCOVI  may  be  used to load the the variance-covariance
 information from the inverse-covariance file:

 $RCOVI FILE=sirsample.coi TBLN=1 DELIM=,

 The FILE=filename option is required.

 If FORMAT or DELIM is used, it should be the same as was specified  on
 the  $ESTIMATION record that created the file to be used.  The default
 is s1PE12.5.

 TBLN is the table number in the file.  If TBLN is  not  specified,  it
 defaults to 1.

 NONMEM describes the use of these records with a message in the report
 file and to the terminal such as the following:

 LOADED VARIANCE/COVARIANCE DATA FROM FILE c5.cov
 If NONMEM is unable to read the file, the message is
 COULD NOT FIND APPROPRIATE VARIANCE/COVARIANCE DATA IN FILE c5.cov

 $RCOV and $RCOVI can be used with the $CHAIN record.  For examples and
 discussion:

 Variance-Covariance information from another problem.
